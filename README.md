# Z-Score Analysis for Fuel Cost Data

This project visualizes fuel cost data with Z-scores to identify anomalies. The dataset contains daily fuel costs for drivers, and the Z-scores help highlight outliers.

## Features
*Data Input:* Reads fuel consumption data from a .csv file.
*Z-Score Calculation:* Leverages pre-calculated Z-scores from the dataset to identify outliers.
*Visualizations:*
- Scatter plots showing Z-scores over time.
- Anomalies highlighted based on Z-score thresholds.
- Threshold Customization: Users can adjust Z-score thresholds to redefine anomaly detection

## Dataset
- `KH Driver.csv`: Contains the fuel cost data, including the calculated Z-scores.
