# Z-Score Analysis for Fuel Cost Data

This project visualizes fuel cost data with Z-scores to identify anomalies. The dataset contains daily fuel costs for drivers, and the Z-scores help highlight outliers.

## Features
- Calculate Z-scores (if not pre-calculated).
- Highlight anomalies based on Z-scores.
- Visualize data trends over time.

## Dataset
- `KH Driver.csv`: Contains the fuel cost data, including the calculated Z-scores.
